# PImage
To insert pins in responsive and dynamic images, PImage has two edit and show versions. In edit mode, it is possible to add pins simply by clicking on the desired location within the image. If you want to change the position of this pin, select it (by clicking on it), drag it with the mouse and drop it wherever you want or use the control located below the map (ideal for touch devices). When adding a pin, it comes with a default name ('pin' + sequential number). To change it, select this pin and click the edit button (first activate the hidden menu by clicking on the ellipsis button at the corner of the screen and then click on the pencil icon). To delete a pin, follow the same steps and click the trash icon (also inside the hidden menu). In the filter feature (available inside the hidden menu, when you click on the magnifying glass icon) you can search for pins by name and locate them on the map by clicking on the button next to each pin. The item you are looking for will change color, increase and decrease in size frequently to catch your attention. If you want to stop this behavior, simply click anywhere on the map or on a pin. In show mode, pins can only be added directly to the array. If you want to change their position, edit the name or delete a pin, it must also be modified directly in the array (in this mode it was not necessary to have a hidden menu so the filter feature is found directly at the corner of the screen, where the hidden menu would be activated). Edit and show modes can be used together within a CRUD system, storing id, name and coordinates in a database through the edit mode by an admin of the system. The show mode would retrieve this data from the database for a user of lower hierarchy and without permission to change information, but who needs to consult them. This project was entirely and solely developed by me. If you use it, please give proper credits.
