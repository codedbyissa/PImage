# 1. Adding Pins

to add pins in edit mode, just click on the desired location inside the image and that's it!

already in view mode, it is necessary to add the pins directly to the array of the index.html file, insert the sequential number id, name of your choice, x coordinates and y coordinates from 1 to 100.

# 2. Move you pins

to move a pin in edit mode just select it (just click on it), drag it with the mouse and drop it where you want.

or you can use the controls on the left corner of the screen (ideal for touchscreen devices). In view mode modify the x and y coordinates of pin until you are satisfied with the new location.

# 3. Delete you pins

you can delete a pin just by selecting it and clicking on the trash can button. this button is located inside the hidden menu in the right corner of the screen, click on the ellipsis icon button to activate it. to delete a pin in edit mode there is no secret, go to the array and delete the desired pin object.

  # 4. Edit the name of your pins

it is possible to edit the name of a pin as many times as you want, select it and click on the button with the pencil icon inside the hidden menu.

an editing screen will be activated, fill it with the desired name and save. for view mode, change directly the name inside the object of the pin you want to modify.

  # 5. Search, filter and locate your pins

the search and filter feature in the edit version can be found in the hidden menu and activated in the magnifying glass icon button. already in the view version it replaced the hidden menu, being necessary only to click on the same button in the right corner of the screen to activate it.

on the screen that was activated, use the search bar to filter pins by name.

and to locate an pin within the map just press the button next to it.

the pin you are looking for will change color, increase and decrease in size frequently to attract attention, if you want to stop this behavior just click on any corner within the image.

  # 6. Show and hide your pin names

the eye button in the right corner of the screen, serves to hide the name of the pins when deactivated and show them when activated (by default it is deactivated).

  # 7. Shortcut to the other mode

I added a button in each mode that maybe isn't very useful, it's a shortcut to the other mode, so if it's in edit mode it's directed to view mode and vice versa (as long as both are in the same folder).
